# Bitcoin-related Dockerfiles and configurations

This is the public repository of dockerfiles used **in production** by [Satoshi Portal](https://www.satoshiportal.com/) for the Bitcoin applications it develops and operates, including [Bylls](https://www.bylls.com/) and [Bitcoin Outlet](https://www.bitcoinoutlet.com/).

We regularily update the existing Dockerfiles and add more. 
<br>See subdirectories for what you are looking for.

**Please submit improvements and post your comments, we definitely want to get better with your help!**

# Features

- Lightweight alpine-based docker containers (runnable on RPiâ€™s and other small devices)
- Using less possible new code, most possible existing OS built-in/well-known softwares
- Using container OS as running platform instead of language-based interpreter
- Encrypting everything through Docker Encrypted Overlay Network
- Distributing everything through Docker Swarm to maximize scallability
- Exposing nothing outside the overlay network

Our philosophy: Security, Lightweight, Performance & Scalability.
